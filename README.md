A powerful and seamless integration to control your Govee lighting devices via Govee API or BLE directly from HomeAssistant.
This repository includes the source from the orignal BLE control reposityory, as well as patches from [cralex96](https://github.com/cralex96/govee_ble_lights) and [Rombond](https://github.com/Rombond/h617a_govee_ble_lights), credit to them for their work.

Here is a compatability table of different light models.

| Model | Change Color | Change Brightness | On/Off |
|-------|--------------|-------------------|--------|
| H617A | ✅           | ✅                | ✅     |
| H617C | ✅           | ✅                | ✅     |

## Configuration

### What is needed

For Direct BLE Control:
- Before you begin, make certain HomeAssistant can access BLE on your platform. Ensure your HomeAssistant instance is granted permissions to utilize the Bluetooth Low Energy of your host machine.

For Govee API Control:
- Retrieve Govee-API-Key as described [here](https://developer.govee.com/reference/apply-you-govee-api-key), setup integration with API type ad fill your API key.

## Usage

With the integration setup, your Govee devices will appear as entities within HomeAssistant. All you need to do is select your device model when adding it.

## Troubleshooting for BLE

If you're facing issues with the integration, consider the following steps:

1. **Check BLE Connection**: 
   
   Ensure that the Govee device is within the Bluetooth range of your HomeAssistant host machine.

2. **Model Check**:

   Check that you selected correct device model.

3. **Logs**:

   HomeAssistant logs can provide insights into any issues. Navigate to `Configuration > Logs` to review any error messages related to the Govee integration.
